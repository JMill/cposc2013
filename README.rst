This is an online guidebook for the talk entitled *Have you opened a book lately?*, by `Jonathan B. Miller <http://jmillville.com>`_, for the Central Pennsylvania Open Source Conference at IU13 Conference and Training Center, Lancaster, PA, on Saturday, October 19th, 2013.


Talk description
=======================

*This presentation explores the motivations and means for authoring books with ""open"" copyright. The difference in gratis and libre philosophies will be briefly contrasted, as well as business models that can help support open book authors.

Using Shaw's learn-x-the-hard-way framework as a base, we will explore how Python, dexy, reStructuredText, LaTeX, and more come together to make a publication-ready technical book. Deployment options for HTML and PDF will be demonstrated. No prior experience required.*


About this code
====================================

This project relies on reStructuredText for content, Python for code samples and graph generation, and `Dexy <http://dexy.it>`_ for bundling everything into a website. 

This project is based loosely on the learn-x-the-hard-way framework by Zed Shaw.

Content may be used with permission.

This code and the accompanying talk are based on my experiences writing the upcoming publication `Learn Stats in 10,000 Hours <http://learnstats.org>`_, a book that teaches Python-powered computational statistics to absolute beginners. Please consider browsing the book or purchasing a copy to help support more contributions to the open source and open book communities. Thanks.

-Jonathan
