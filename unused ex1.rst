Using the Console
===========================

In order to show how you can easily collect samples of datasets, I will introduce you to an alternate way to explore data, using Python's *console*. Typing directly into the console is handy for experimenting with simple commands. Unlike when running long scripts (the .py files), the console tells you immediately if the computer can process the line of code you just typed.

In Canopy, Python's console is located on below the word "Python".

Yours may look a little different, but it probably shows something like ``In [1]`` or ``>>>``.  Regardless of the line's label, it conveys that you can *input* a command.  If the command you typed is error-free, any relevant *output* will be displayed beneath the command you just typed.

Lets play with the console to see how Python works.
