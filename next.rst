The Path Ahead
*******************************

There are a couple different paths to take depending on how this workshop went for you.

* Read `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_, by Zed Shaw. It's the natural follow-on to this workshop. It's an intro to Python for the absolute beginner. Sort of like this workshop but more detail and chock-full of guided exercises.

* Sign up to read `Learn Stats in 10,000 Hours <http://learnstats.org>`_, by Jonathan Miller (me). It's a Python-powered introduction to statistics for the complete novice.

* `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`_ by Mark Pilgrim.

* `MITx's Introduction to Computer Science <https://www.edx.org/course/mit/6-00x/introduction-computer-science/586>`_ is an in-depth, applied treatment of Python. It's a free online course.

For specific fields of interest in Python-land, check out:

* `The Django Tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/>`_ for making powerful web applications.
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ if you like science, math, and engineering. 
* `Dexy <http://dexy.it/>`_ for publishing content, including dead tree books, ebooks, PDFs, and websites (including this one).
* `Natural Language Tool Kit <http://nltk.org/>`_ for doing all levels of written text analysis, from studying the vocabulary of *Moby Dick* or J.K. Rowling (`interesting article <http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/19/how-forensic-linguistics-outed-j-k-rowling-not-to-mention-james-madison-barack-obama-and-the-rest-of-us/>`_) to developing better spam filters and chatbots.

Stick with it
=====================

As we started this workshop, I stated that learning a programming language is just like learning a traditional, spoken language. And just like learning a spoken language, you won't be programming the next Reddit or Google just yet -- but you're on the path! Immerse yourself in the resources listed above. Heck, don't just stay with Python. `Try Ruby. <http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0>`_ `Or C. <http://c.learncodethehardway.org/>`_ There's so much out there.

And, more importantly, our communities are enriched when "non-traditional" programmers start building and sharing their work. An English Lit major who writes a program that can publish a new book a day, in the style of Dickens or Thoreau. Or an interpretive dancer who writes a web app to help fellow dancers collaborate remotely.  I'm making this stuff up, but the real-life stories are much more shocking -- and motivating.

In the words of Zed Shaw:

	People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.
