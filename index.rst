Talk description
=======================

*This presentation explores the motivations and means for authoring books with "open" copyright. The difference in gratis and libre philosophies will be briefly contrasted, as well as business models that can help support open book authors.*

*Using Shaw's learn-x-the-hard-way framework as a base, we will explore how Python, dexy, reStructuredText, LaTeX, and more come together to make a publication-ready technical book. Deployment options for HTML and PDF will be demonstrated. No prior experience required.*
